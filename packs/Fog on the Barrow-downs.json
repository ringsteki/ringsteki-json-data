If an encounter card has an effect that uses the word `you` then the encounter card is referring to the player who revealed the card. If the revealed card has the Surge keyword, the player who revealed it reveals an additional card. Encounter cards with the Doomed X keyword still affect each player.\n\nPeril Keyword\n\nWhen a player reveals an encounter card with the the Peril keyword, he must resolve that staging of that card on his own without conferring with ther other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card`s staging."

The players as a group still cannot have more than 1 copy of a unique card in play.\n\nDuring the encounter phase, players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area.
